# Computer-vision-for-Multi-Object-Tracking
This project implements a **Multi-Object Tracking (MOT)** system using computer vision techniques. It tracks multiple objects in real-time video streams by detecting and associating objects across frames.

## Features
- Real-time object detection and tracking.
- Handles multiple objects simultaneously.
- Supports various object detection models (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN).
- Provides visualization of tracked objects and their IDs.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the model used)
- other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Install dependencies
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-object-tracking.git
   cd multi-object-tracking
